# resourcesync-oai-pmh

This is a collection of wrapper scripts for easy setup and use of both sides (source and destination) of the [ResourceSync web synchronization framework](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/resourcesync) with existing [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) metadata providers on the source side and a Solr index (in addition to a scheduling server) on the destination side. This solution was developed for UCLA's PRRLA project. For project information, visit http://pr-rla.org and http://prl.library.ucla.edu/about.

If your institution will be providing metadata records for PRL, visit our [wiki](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/resourcesync-oai-pmh/wiki/Technical-Prerequisites-for-Member-Institution-Participation) to get started.
