# resourcesync-oai-pmh

This is an implementation of both sides (source and destination) of the [ResourceSync web synchronization framework](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/resourcesync) by leveraging existing [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) metadata providers. This implementation was developed for UCLA's PRRLA project.
